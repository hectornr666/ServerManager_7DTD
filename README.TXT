7 Days to Die Server Mod Framework
----------------------------------

Initial design by Benjamin Keller, 2015.

Maintainer: Renato Borges.

This project is a Python 3 package that provides:

- An API to command the server.
- A game event handler.
- Common functionalities for third-party mods, such as a player database.

The vision for this project is that there is a need for a wide scope of features that many "flavored" mods require. For example, a "quest" mod will require a player database. Instead of each "quest" mod deploying its own, the use of a common framework would allow faster development and possible interplay of these mods (enhancing the game experience for everyone :)
